Project purpose and structure:
    The title of this project is 'PROJECT: SAVE VALENTINES'.
    This is a website designed especially for people who forgot about a certain event and need to make last minute arrangements.

    I know what you're thinking, this is perfect for that one boyfriend that keeps forgetting anniverseries and birthdays.
    As much as this character is concerning, considering he can simply put a reminder on his calender and organize a propper suprise, life get busy, so sometimes you can't blame him (I guess)

    Anyways, enough about this incapable boyfriend. this website can also be used by people who plan and prepare early. Organize your suprise for your loved one, tailor it to your preference and schedule when we should execute your plan.

    This website isn't only for couples but also for any other relationship like friendship or even parent-child relationship. As long as the person is special to you, go ahead and book one of our services.
